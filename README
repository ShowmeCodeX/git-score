git-score is a simple script that computes 'scores' for authors who have
contributed to a git repository.

INSTALLATION

Copy git-score to somewhere in your PATH. A good solution is to place a
git-score symlink in ~/bin that points to your git-score repository.

USAGE

Inside a git repository, just run

% git-score

It takes the following arguments directly:

  --exclude-files=<pattern>
    Tallies scores per-file, and if <pattern> matches the filename.
    This is useful to exclude directories or particular file extensions.
    Warning: may run much slower. Still untested on very large repos.

  --include-files=<pattern>
    Same as exclude, but the reverse. (<pattern> must match)

All other arguments will be passed to `git log'. This way, you can specify
revision ranges to narrow scoring to a particular set of commits.

% git-score 61bf126e..HEAD

NOTE: The hyphen ('-') is optional: 'git score' works too on recent versions of
      git.
