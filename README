git-score is a simple script that computes 'scores' for authors who have
contributed to a git repository.

USAGE

Inside a git repository, just run

% git-score

It takes the following arguments directly:

  --exclude-re=<pattern>
    Tallies scores per-file, and only if <pattern> does not match the filename.
    This is useful to exclude directories or particular file extensions.

All other arguments will be passed to `git log'. This way, you can specify
revision ranges to narrow scoring to a particular set of commits.

% git-score 61bf126e..HEAD
