git-score is a simple script that computes 'scores' for authors who have
contributed to a git repository.

USAGE

Inside a git repository, just run

% git-score

It takes no arguments directly, but if you do specify them, they will be passed
to `git log'. This way, you can specify revision ranges to narrow scoring to a
particular set of commits.

% git-score 61bf126e..HEAD
